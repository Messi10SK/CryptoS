          <p className="text-lg mb-4">
            Cryptocurrencies leverage blockchain technology to gain decentralization, transparency, and immutability. The blockchain is a distributed ledger that records all transactions across a network of computers.

          </div>
          <p className="text-lg">
            When someone sends cryptocurrency, the transaction is verified by a decentralized network of computers, called nodes, and then added to the blockchain. This process ensures that transactions are secure and prevents double-spending.
